- pattern match strings against regular expressions
- regular expressions can be written inline in patterns, anywhere a string could match
- direct extraction of capturing groups in patterns
- typed extraction (into `List`s or [Vacuous](https://github.com/propensive/vacuous/) `Optional`s) of variable-length capturing groups
- static checking of regular expression syntax
- simpler "glob" syntax is also provided
